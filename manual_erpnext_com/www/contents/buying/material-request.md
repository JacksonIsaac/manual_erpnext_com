A Material Request is a simple document identifying a requirement of a set of
Items (products or services) for a particular reason.

#### Creating Material Request

A Material Request can be generated:

  * Automatically from a Sales Order.
  * Automatically when the Projected Quantity of an Item in stores reaches a particular level.
  * Automatically from your Bill of Materials if you use Production Plan to plan your manufacturing activities.
  * If your Items are inventory items, you must also mention the Warehouse where you expect these Items to be delivered. This helps to keep track of the [Projected Quantity](/contents/stock/projected-quantity) for this Item.

> Info: Material Request is not mandatory. It is ideal if you have centralized
buying so that you can collect this information from various departments.
