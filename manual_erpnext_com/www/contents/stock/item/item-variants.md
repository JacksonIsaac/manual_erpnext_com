A Item Variant is a different version of a Item, such as differing sizes or differing colours.
Without Item variants, you would have to treat the small, medium and large versions of a t-shirt as three separate Items; 
Item variants let you treat the small, medium and large versions of a t-shirt as variations of the same Item.

To manage Item Variants in ERPNext, create an Item and check 'Has Variants'

* The Item shall then be refered as a 'Template'
