Warehouse, to a Warehouse and between Warehouses.

Stock Entries can be made for the following purposes:

* Material Issue - If the material is being issued. (Outgoing Material)
* Material Receipt - If the material is being received. (Incoming Material)
* Material Transfer - If the material is being moved from one warehouse to another.
* Material Transfer for Manufacturing - If the material being transfered is for Manufacturing Process.
* Manufacture - If the Material is being received from a Manufacturing/Production Operation.
* Repack - If the Original item/items is being repacked into new item/items.
* Subcontract - If the Material is being issued for a sub-contract activity.
* Sales Return - If the Material that was sold was returned by the customer.
* Purchase Return - If you have returned a material supplied by a supplier.

In the Stock Entry you have to update the Items table with all your
transactions. For each row, you must enter a “Source Warehouse” or a “Target
Warehouse” or both (if you are recording a movement).
