## Project

Project Management in ERPNext is Task driven. You can create Project and assign multiple Tasks against it.
Expected Start and End Dates can be defined against a project. 
One can also define the Customer for whom the Project is being undertaken. 
You can also set the estimated cost of the project and mention a default cost centre for all expenses booked against that project.
ERPNext shall track the actual time & costing against a project using Time Logs.
The Actual Start and End date along with the actual costing of the project shall be tracked against each Time Log and updated in the Project. 
The Gross Profit and Gross Profit Percentage shall also be calculated by the system based on the actual values.

The Project record can be linked in Quotations, Sales Orders,
Delivery Notes, Sales Invoices, Purchase Requests, Purchase Orders and
Purchase Invoices. This way you can keep a track of all the activities that
happen around this project.
