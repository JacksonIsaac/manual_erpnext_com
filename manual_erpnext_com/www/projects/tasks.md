## Tasks

Project is divided into Tasks. 
ERPNext, you can also create and allocate a Task independently of a Project.
If you define the start and end dates, it will add calendar events for the
same and also show the task on the Gantt Chart that you can use for monitoring
the Project.

Time Logs are used to track task. You can create multiple Time Logs against a Task. 
The costing is updated in the Task based on the costing of the Time Logs.

You can also make expense claims against Task.
